## Overview
So this is the first newbie challenge ive dealt with. First i wrote the HTML of the solution, building the h1, p and img elements. I visualized the solution given and i thought that i first had to create a container (div) for the entire card since i would later want to style it. I moved on onto the image wrapping it up also in a container(another div) since i noticed that its at least styled with the CSS border radius property. Next i gave the elements a class including the two divs in order to style them in my separate css file. In CSS while styling the whole card first i tried to center it in order to match the design given. I used margin: auto; in order to center it horizontically in order for the card to take up whatever width its specified in the CSS and then the browser will split the remaining space between the margins on either side. I used the margin shorthand property margin: 100 auto; to center the card. Then i added the specific border radius for each div. The single most important feature i added in CSS is oveflow: hidden; while styling the card in order to stop the content inside from oveflowing. I then added some padding inside the card to fit the image. These were the primary challenging features. The rest of the card is easy since i only changed the font size and family of the elements.
